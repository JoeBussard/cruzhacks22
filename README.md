# cruzhacks22
Repository for our cruzhacks project, which involves using a streamlined user interface to find students that want to work on projects with you.  By streamlining the process of finding teammates and like minded students it gets rid of the overhead of thinking about what to make and instead gets you set up with a team right away and ready to start hacking.
